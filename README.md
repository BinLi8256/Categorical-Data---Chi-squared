# Categorical Data Analysis -- Chi-squared test of Independence
Recently, I am working with categorical data frequently. So, I just want to give a short summary about categorical data analysis and Chi-squared test of independence. It can be used in exploratory data analysis to detect the significance when you have a lot of variables before building a model. 

I used simulated data to run the toy example. It contains the set-up about chi-squared test and interpretation for the results.
